# DashboardVirtualScroll

## API
* /getPanelItems - returns Array\<PanelItem\> - Refer type in APIService

## Components & Services

### Components
* Card (pure)
* Card-Dialog (pure)
* Video-player (pure)

### Services
* APIService

## Data Flow

* The fetching of data takes place in the APIService
* The sorting & filter utils are written in the APIService
* The Cards-List component has the APIService injected & all other components follow 
## Modular Separation
* All the pure components to be developed in parallel
*  The service is to be developed in sync with changes in the API request / response

## Test cases
* Unit cases for Card, Dialog, Video-Player, Cards-List - for the UI / UX grammar
* Screenshot comparison for previous release compliance
* Responsive UI testing for breakpoints
* Performance / benchmark test cases Cards-List
	* No. of rows in DOM when using virtual scroll
	* Maximum count of array elements the list can render etc
	* Number of simulataneous video tags that can play without crashing the tab

## Libraries used
* "@faker-js/faker": "^7.6.0"
	* Generate fake data for API simulation
* "@lithiumjs/ngx-virtual-scroll": "^0.2.2"
	* Virytal scrolling library for boosting scroll performance
* "video.js": "^7.20.3"
	* Alternative video tag skin for better customization

## Bugs / Limitations
* Sort is supported for date
* Filter is supported for usernames
* Virtual scroll does not trigger for certain smaller breakpoints
* Sorting requires new Array instance - library limitation, but the memory is replaced and not accumulated
* Body scroll to be handled in virtual scroll - needs details DOM surgery in complaince with the virtual scroll library
* Icons are taken from material instead of original
* Certain UI / UX yet to be polished pixel perfect (dimensions & colors)
